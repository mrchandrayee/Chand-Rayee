            <h3>Web developer next.Js, react.js, Vue.js</h3>
            <p>I've spent years in the framework, using it to do the heavy lifting for rapidly building prototypes/MVPs and carefully crafting robust, performance, and scale-able production systems.

            <p>Beyond that, I have low-level systems experience and native Android development experience. I also have data science and visualization expertise, and I am familiar with the scientific Python stack and D3 JS.</p>
